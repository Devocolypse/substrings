# Substring Finder in Ruby

This program finds and records the number of substrings within another string. It provides two
similar methods for doing so, and both require two parameters:

- `string`: any string, whether a word or an entire sentence
- `dictionary`: an array of strings, each one word, as it needs to compare them as potential substrings

## Instructions

Easiest way to run the program at the moment is to [require][1] the file in IRB (Interactive Ruby),
then running either of the provided methods (they both should return the same output given the same
input). It is recommended to define your arguments in variables before plugging them in to the
methods.
